        <span>P</span>rotein, highly complex substance that is present in all living organisms.<br> Proteins are of great nutritional value and are directly involved in the chemical processes essential for life.<br>
        The importance of proteins was recognized by chemists in the early 19th century, including Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who in 1838 coined the term protein, a word derived from the Greek prōteios, meaning “holding first place.”<br>
        Proteins are species-specific; that is, the proteins of one species differ from those of another species. They are also organ-specific; for instance, within a single organism, muscle proteins differ from those of the brain and liver.</p>
        <h2>What is the structure of protein..?</h2>
        <p><span>F</span>rom a chemical point of view, proteins are by far the most structurally complex and functionally sophisticated molecules known.<br> 
            This is perhaps not surprising, once one realizes that the structure and chemistry of each protein has been developed and fine-tuned over billions of years of evolutionary history.<br>
            Protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids. By physical size, proteins are classified as nanoparticles, between 1–100 nm. Very large protein complexes can be formed from protein subunits. For example, many thousands of actin molecules assemble into a microfilament.<br>
            A protein usually undergoes reversible structural changes in performing its biological function. The alternative structures of the same protein are referred to as different conformations, and transitions between them are called conformational changes.</p>
