        <h2>Starchy foods known as Carbs.</h2>
        <p>
           <span>S</span>tarchy foods are an important source of energy. After they are eaten, they are broken down into glucose, which is the body’s main fuel,<br> especially for our brain and muscles. Starchy foods provide important nutrients to the diet including B vitamins, iron, calcium and folate. Starchy foods can also provide fibre which is needed for good digestive health and is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer.
        </p>
        <h2>Starchy foods and fibre.</h2>
        <p>
           <span>W</span>holegrain varieties of starchy foods and potatoes (particularly when eaten with their skin on) are good sources of fibre.<br>
            Fibre is the name given to a range of substances found in the cell walls of vegetables, fruits, pulses and cereal grains. <br>
            Potato skins, wholegrain bread and breakfast cereals, brown rice, and wholewheat pasta are all good sources of this kind of fibre.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>S</span>ome types of fibre found in fruits and vegetables – such as apples, carrots, potatoes – and in oats and pulses can be partly digested and may help reduce the amount of cholesterol in your blood.
        </p>
        <h2>Acrylamide in starchy food.</h2>
        <p>
            <span>A</span>crylamide is a chemical that's created when many foods, particularly starchy foods like potatoes and bread, are cooked for long periods at high temperatures, such as when baking, frying, grilling, toasting and roasting.<br> <br>
            There's evidence to show acrylamide can cause cancer.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips to get enough starchy foods..</h2>
        <p>
            <span>A</span>t breakfast: Start the day with an energy-giving starchy food like wholemeal toast, porridge or a healthy wholegrain breakfast cereal.<br>
            <span>A</span>t lunch: Try out different types of breads - rolls, wraps, pita or sliced bread – and go for wholegrain breads as often as you can.<br>
            <span>A</span>t dinner: Base your meal on a starchy food like potatoes, rice, pasta or bread.
